	<td><p>Description </p></td>
	<td><p>'We' are a group of individuals who love RPGs as a video game genre. Live-action, turn-based, and everything in between; we enjoy role-playing games to the highest degree. Responding to fan enthusiasm, we attempt to persuade the "powers that be" in the video game industry to create RPGs and to localize the ones that never make it to the US/Europe.</p>
